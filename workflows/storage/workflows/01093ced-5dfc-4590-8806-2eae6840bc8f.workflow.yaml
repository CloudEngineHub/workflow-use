steps:
- description: Navigate to https://github.com
  output: null
  type: navigation
  url: https://github.com
  agent_reasoning: The ultimate goal is to go to GitHub, search for "browser-use",
    click on the repository, and extract the star count. Since the current page is
    empty, the first step is to navigate to GitHub.

  agent_reasoning: The previous step of navigating to GitHub was successful. The next
    goal is to search for "browser-use". I see a search input element labeled "Search
    or jump to..." which is part of a `qbsearch-input` component. I will use the button
    [653] to focus on the search and then input the search query. Since [653] is a
    button with a placeholder, I'll try clicking it first to see if it opens the search
    box, and then look for the input field. If that doesn't work, I'll try to find
    the actual input field. Looking at the structure, [651] is `<qbsearch-input />`
    which likely contains the input field. [653] is a `<button>` inside a `<div>`
    inside the `qbsearch-input`. I will try clicking [653] first.

  agent_reasoning: The previous step of inputting "browser-use" and pressing Enter
    was successful, and I am now on the search results page. The immediate goal is
    to find and click the "browser-use" repository link. Since the search was executed,
    the current page should display the results. I need to scroll down to see the
    search results or use `find_text` to locate the repository link. Since the current
    view is still showing the search modal/overlay, I will scroll down to see the
    results page content.

- description: Scroll down 1.0 pages
  output: null
  type: scroll
  scrollX: 0
  scrollY: 800
  agent_reasoning: The previous step of scrolling down was performed because the search
    results were expected to be below the current view, which was still showing the
    search modal/overlay after pressing Enter. However, the current browser state
    still shows the search overlay elements (like the query builder and suggestions)
    at the top, and the main content of the search results page is still below. I
    need to scroll further down to see the search results, or the search result page
    might not have loaded correctly after the Enter key, or the scroll didn't move
    the viewport enough relative to the search results. I will try scrolling down
    again to ensure the search results are visible. The page info shows 11.1 pages
    below, so scrolling is necessary.

- description: Scroll down 5.0 pages
  output: null
  type: scroll
  scrollX: 0
  scrollY: 4000
  agent_reasoning: The previous two steps involved scrolling down, but the browser
    state still shows the search overlay prominently, and the search results are not
    yet visible. I need to scroll down significantly more to get past the initial
    landing page content and see the search results page content. The page info suggests
    11.1 pages below, so I will scroll down by a larger amount (e.g., 5 pages) to
    ensure I reach the search results.

- description: Scroll down 10.0 pages
  output: null
  type: scroll
  scrollX: 0
  scrollY: 8000
  agent_reasoning: The previous steps involved navigating to GitHub, searching for
    "browser-use", and repeatedly scrolling down. Despite three attempts at scrolling,
    the browser state still shows the search overlay and the initial landing page
    content, not the actual search results page content. This suggests that either
    the search was not executed correctly, or the search results are very far down,
    or the page structure is confusing and the search results are hidden. Since I
    pressed Enter after inputting the text, the search should have executed. I will
    try scrolling down one more time, but this time I will use `scroll(down=True,
    pages=10)` to ensure I reach the bottom of the page and see the search results.
    If that fails, I will suspect the search execution failed and try to find a "Search"
    button to click instead of relying on the Enter key, or re-evaluate the search
    input. Given the page info shows 11.1 pages below, scrolling to the bottom is
    the next logical step to confirm the search results are loaded.

  agent_reasoning: 'Despite multiple attempts to scroll down, the search results page
    content is still not visible, and the search overlay remains prominent. This strongly
    suggests that either the search was not successfully executed (i.e., pressing
    Enter in the shadow DOM input didn''t trigger the navigation), or the search results
    are not on the current page but require a click on a specific search result link
    within the overlay to navigate to the results page.


    Looking at the current interactive elements, I see a suggestion: `[10021]<li role=option
    id=query-builder-test-result-browser-use aria-label=browser-use, Search all of
    GitHub selected=false />`. This list item represents the search result/suggestion
    "browser-use, Search all of GitHub". I should click this element to execute the
    search and navigate to the results page.'

  agent_reasoning: The previous step of clicking the search suggestion successfully
    navigated to the repository search results page for "browser-use". I can confirm
    this by the current URL and the page title. The next immediate goal is to click
    on the correct repository link, which is "browser-use/browser-use" based on the
    user request and the search results list. I see element [14628] which is an `<a>`
    tag with the text "browser-use/ browser-use". This is the target repository. After
    clicking, I will be on the repository page and can extract the star count.
