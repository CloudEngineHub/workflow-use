- description: Navigate to https://github.com
  output: null
  type: navigation
  url: https://github.com
  agent_reasoning: The first step is to navigate to GitHub. Since the current page
    is empty, I will use the `navigate` action. The ultimate goal is to find the "browser-use"
    repository and extract its star count.

  agent_reasoning: "The previous step of waiting for 3 seconds was successful, and\
    \ the page content is now visible. The immediate goal is to find the search bar\
    \ and input \"browser-use\". I see an interactive element `[520]<button aria-label=Search\
    \ or jump to\u2026 placeholder=Search or jump to... />` which looks like the search\
    \ button/input. It is wrapped in a `qbsearch-input` element. I will click this\
    \ button to activate the search input, and then input the search query."

  agent_reasoning: 'The previous step used `send_keys("browser-use{Enter}")` as a
    last resort to input the search query after repeated failures with `evaluate()`
    on the shadow DOM input. The current browser state shows the text "browser-use{Enter}"
    has been entered into the search box, but the search has not yet been executed
    (the page hasn''t changed to the search results). The input field is still visible.
    I need to trigger the search. Since the `send_keys` included `{Enter}`, the search
    should have been submitted, but it seems GitHub''s search mechanism requires a
    click on a suggestion or a specific search button if the input is inside a complex
    component.


    Looking at the current state, there is a suggestion `[7052]` which says `browser-use{Enter},
    Search all of GitHub`. This suggests the text was entered but the search wasn''t
    executed. I will try to click the suggestion `[7052]` to execute the search.'
